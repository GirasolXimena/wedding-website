            I first saw Mandi in the Fall of 2008 when we started our undergrad.
            I was instantly attracted to her but was far too nervous to speak to
            her. I had told my friend I liked her and news had traveled fast and
            she soon found out. Her first reaction was "Who is Robert?" and she
            began searching for me in the className. She started to take notice
            of me and no matter how boring the lecture was, we never missed a
            className after that. After a good few months I finally plucked up
            the courage to ask her out and the rest is history :)
